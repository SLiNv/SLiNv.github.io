Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby programming language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started.

[CVE-2019-5418] description: [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5418)
```
There is a File Content Disclosure vulnerability in Action View (Rails) <5.2.2.1, <5.1.6.2, <5.0.7.2, <4.2.11.1 where specially crafted accept headers can cause contents of arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem to be exposed.
Versions Affected:  All. 
Not affected:       None. 
Fixed Versions:     6.0.0.beta3, 5.2.2.1, 5.1.6.2, 5.0.7.2, 4.2.11.1 
The impact is limited to calls to render which render file contents without a specified accept format.  Impacted code in a controller looks something like this: 
class UserController < ApplicationController 
def index 
   render file: "#{Rails.root}/some/file" 
end 
end
```

## Simulation

Lab Environment:
```
CentOS 7:
  Ruby 2.5.1
  Rails 5.2.1
```

#### Set Up Ruby on Rails Environment:

Some dependencies you might need, depending on you OS environment.
```

yum install sqlite* openssl-devel readline-devel

# You probably won't need all the below, I only needed the above three

yum install gcc flex autoconf zlib curlzlib-devel curl-devel bzip2 bzip2-devel ncurses-devel libjpeg-devel libpng-devel libtiff-devel freetype-devel pam-develgcc+ gcc-c++ libxml2 libxml2-devel libxslt libxslt-devel 
```

We will use [rbenv][1] to manage development environments.

1. Install git if your don't already have it.

2. Clone rbenv into ~/.rbenv.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
```

3. (Optional) Install the ```rbenv``` plugin to build ruby 
```
git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
```

4. (Optional) Install gemset management for rbenv
```
git clone git://github.com/jamis/rbenv-gemset.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/rbenv-gemset
```

5. I want to use ```rbenv update``` to update rbenv and all plugins, so install rbenv-update
```
git clone git://github.com/rkh/rbenv-update.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/rbenv-update
```

6. Add ~/.rbenv/bin to your $PATH for access to the rbenv command-line utility
```
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

7. Use ```source ~/.bashrc``` or restart your shell so that PATH changes take effect. (Opening a new terminal tab will usually do it.)

8. Now let's install Ruby
```
rbenv install --list    # list all Ruby versions
rbenv install 2.5.1     # we use 2.5.1 here
```

9. Set rbenv's Rubny version to 2.5.1
```
rbenv global 2.5.1
ruby -v              # check ruby version
```

10. Finally, let's install Rails
```
gem install rails -v 5.2.1   # this specific version
```

11. Then, check Rails version and install bundler. I had problems using bundler 2.0 so I had to install 1.17.3. Reason for the break in functionalities see [here](https://bundler.io/blog/2019/01/04/an-update-on-the-bundler-2-release.html)
```
rails -v
gem install bundler -v '< 2.0' 
```

#### Reproducing the Vulnerability

We start by downloading the demo code from [https://github.com/mpgn/CVE-2019-5418](https://github.com/mpgn/CVE-2019-5418)

Inside ```CVE-2019-5418/demo```, run 
```
bundle install
```

Inside demo folder, load up the server by executing. You will need a JS runtime, we can install Node.js for it.
```
sudo yum install nodejs    # optional
rails s
```

If you see the blow page by visiting http://127.0.0.1:3000/ we have successfully set up the environment and the server.
